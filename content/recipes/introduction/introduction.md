# Introduction to project ICARIA

The number of climate-related disasters has been progressively increasing in the last two decades and this trend could be drastically exacerbated in the medium- and long-term horizons according to climate change projections. It is estimated that, between 2000 and 2019, 7,348 natural hazard-related disasters have occurred worldwide, causing 2.97 trillion US$ losses and affecting 4 billion people (UNDRR, 2020). These numbers represent a sharp increase in the number of recorded disaster events in comparison with the previous twenty years. Much of this increase is due to a significant rise in the number of climate-related disasters (heatwaves, droughts, flooding, etc.), including compound events, whose frequency is dramatically increasing because of the effects of climate change and related global warming. In the future, by mid-century, the world stands to lose around 10% of total economic value from climate change if the temperature increase stays on the current trajectory, and both the Paris Agreement and 2050 net-zero emissions targets are not met.
  
> In this framework, Project ICARIA has the overall objective to promote the definition and the use of a comprehensive asset-level modeling framework to achieve a better understanding of climate-related impacts produced by complex, compound, and cascading disasters and the possible risk reduction provided by suitable, sustainable and cost-effective adaptation solutions. This project will be especially devoted to critical assets and infrastructures that are susceptible to climate change, in a sense that its local effects can result in significant increases in the cost of potential losses for unplanned outages and failures, as well as maintenance â€“ unless an effort is undertaken in making these assets more resilient. ICARIA aims to understand how future climate might affect the life-cycle costs of these assets in the coming decades and to ensure that, where possible, investments in terms of adaptation measures are made upfront to face these changes. 
 
 
To achieve this aim, ICARIA has identified 7 Strategic Subobjectives ({index}`SSO`), each one related to one or several work packages. They have been classified according to different categories: scientific, corresponding to research activities for advances beyond the state of the art (SSO1, SSO2, SSO3, SSO4, SO5); technological, suggesting and/or developing novel solutions, integrating state-of-the-art and digital advances (SSO6); societal, contributing to the improved dialogue, awareness, cooperation and community engagement as highlighted by the European Climate Pact (SSO7); and related to dissemination and exploitation, aimed at sharing ICARIA results to a broader audience and number of regions and communities to maximize project impact (SSO7).
 - SSO1.- Achievement of a comprehensive methodology to assess climate-related risk produced by complex, cascading, and compound disasters
 - SSO2.- Obtaining tailored scenarios for the case studies regions
 - SSO3.- Quantify uncertainty and manage data gaps through model input requirements and innovative methods
 - SSO4.- Increase the knowledge on climate-related disasters (including interactions between compound events and cascading effects) by developing and implementing advanced modeling for multi-hazard assessment
 - SSO5.- Better assessment of holistic resilience and climate-related impacts for current and future scenarios
 - SSO6.- Better decision-making for cost-efficient adaptation solutions by developing a Decision Support System ({index}`DSS`) to compare adaptation solutions
 - SSO7.- Ensure the use and impact of the ICARIA outputs.
