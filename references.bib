abstract={Machine learning approaches are increasingly used to extract patterns and insights from the ever-increasing stream of geospatial data, but current approaches may not be optimal when system behaviour is dominated by spatial or temporal context. Here, rather than amending classical machine learning, we argue that these contextual cues should be used as part of deep learning (an approach that is able to extract spatio-temporal features automatically) to gain further process understanding of Earth system science problems, improving the predictive ability of seasonal forecasting and modelling of long-range spatial connections across multiple timescales, for example. The next step will be a hybrid modelling approach, coupling physical process models with the versatility of data-driven machine learning.},

abstract="Our social, cultural and economic sustainability and that of future generations depend on quality decisions and policies that address risks and opportunities. As these decisions and policies are for the most part evidence-based and uncertainties are inherent in that evidence, the quality of those decisions and policies requires effective use of that evidence, including the uncertainties. This chapter provides an introduction to this subject and to the experiences and lessons learnt presented in the publication. It indicates why the authors of the publication believe such a publication is needed and the audience we believe will benefit from such a publication. It also provides a brief description of the content of the ensuing chapters and suggests alternative pathways by which those with specific interests may navigate through the publication. In so doing, the intention has been to invite those interested to learn from others and benefit from those shared experiences.",

abstract="In this chapter, we introduce the basics of Bayesian data analysis. The key ingredients to a Bayesian analysis are the likelihood function, which reflects information about the parameters contained in the data, and the prior distribution, which quantifies what is known about the parameters before observing data. The prior distribution and likelihood can be easily combined to from the posterior distribution, which represents total knowledge about the parameters after the data have been observed. Simple summaries of this distribution can be used to isolate quantities of interest and ultimately to draw substantive conclusions. We illustrate each of these steps of a typical Bayesian analysis using three biomedical examples and briefly discuss more advanced topics, including prediction, Monte Carlo computational methods, and multilevel models.",
