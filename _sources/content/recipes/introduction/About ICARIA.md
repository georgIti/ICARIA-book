# About ICARIA project

## Climate hazards and extreme weather: A call for urgent action

According to the United Nations, climate hazard-related disasters have risen significantly, with over `7,000 incidents between 2000 and 2019`. These events impacted 4 billion people and caused nearly $3 trillion in losses. This surge is primarily due to extreme weather events. If global temperatures continue to rise and net-zero targets aren’t met by 2050, 10% of the world’s economic value may be lost.

Empowering Climate Resilience: ICARIA’s Asset-Level Modeling Approach for Sustainable and Cost-Effective Adaptation Solutions
In face of this situation, ICARIA aims to promote the use of asset-level modelling framework to better understand climate-related impacts and reduce the risk by providing sustainable and cost-effective adaptation solutions.

## Developing and Replicating Climate Adaptation Solutions

ICARIA researches `three European case studies` to understand climate impacts and develop adaptation solutions. These include two Mediterranean coastal areas – `Barcelona Metropolitan Area` and the `South Aegean Archipelago` – and `Salzburg, Austria`, all facing severe climate challenges. The project assesses solution replicability across these regions and five additional areas, ultimately providing regional-scale adaptation scenarios accounting for climate and socioeconomic factors.

## Key outcomes
