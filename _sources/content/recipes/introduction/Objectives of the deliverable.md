# <u> Obejctives of the deliverable </u>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The document presents the creation of a complementary cookbook and the results of a domain user survey conducted within the ICARIA project. Specifically, this document corresponds to Deliverable 1.3 and includes the results of Task 1.3- Modeling input requirements and methods to treat data gaps and uncertainties (WP1 - Project framework, climate scenarios, and modeling inputs). </div>

## <u> The necessity for a cookbook and a domain survey </u>
Climate change impacts are produced by complex interactions, and are often characterized by compound events and cascading effects that demand tailored-made, sustainable adaptation solutions. To support the ICARIA holistic asset-level modeling framework defined in *D1.1*, this deliverable introduces a set of methodologies and tools to treat data gap and uncertainties with respect to modelling input requirements relevant for the case study areas, which has been designed as a “cookbook” potentially transferable to other contexts. Additionally, a dedicated domain user survey has been designed to specifically highlight critical data gaps recurring in the field of hazard and impact assessment. The necessity of both is preparatory, providing merely a scaffold for potential support and improvement of the current state-of-the-art methodologies already employed in ICARIA, which will be then tested in *D1.4* for a number selected data gaps in the case study areas, and further applied in WP4 to cover all relevant data gaps emerging from the Trial execution. \
The main goals of D1.3 are summarized as follows: \
 - Identification of recurring data gaps in hazard/impact assessment: this ambitious task is achieved through a twofold approach. Firstly, ICARIA Case Study Facilitators focused on data gaps related to the implementation of Trials and Mini-Trials in the case-study areas. In parallel, experts will be engaged via the domain survey, to provide feedback on data-driven techniques so that the practitioners can comprehensively understand the current limitations and prioritize which data gaps need to be addressed with priority. 
 - Creation of a list of alternative methods: to supplement the methodologies identified with respect to the key variables and datasets emerging from the impact assessment modelling architecture defined for the ICARIA case studies and based on the proposed holistic modelling framework (see D1.1, Section 3), and to investigate and identify the possibility for filling of data gaps via data augmentation/substitution techniques and/or expert knowledge collection.
 - Improvement of data granularity supporting quantitative impact assessments: due to the observed lack of comprehensive datasets that can support assessments at local level (i.e. sub-regional, urban level), both concerning climate change and hazard assessment for complex events, both for exposure and vulnerability analyses, alternative routes need to be explored, including but not limited to the creation of synthetic data through statistical approaches, dynamical downscaling and/or expert elicitation methods. The latter, in particular, offers a unique opportunity to address recurring data gaps in multi-hazard assessment (e.g. probability of occurrence of coincident compound events, probability of hazard transition in consecutive compound events and/or cascading effects scenarios), detailed quantitative exposure and/or vulnerability analysis (e.g. recurring construction typologies in a given area; health implication of different heat stress levels on specific age groups) that cannot be treated otherwise for the lack of data.
 - Exploration of advanced data-driven methodologies: The enormously expanding production of data through remote sensing and research at global level, increasingly available through public data repository and open web platforms, suggests the effectiveness of approaches aimed at harnessing/handling information and addressing data gaps through data-driven methodologies supported by machine learning, AI and data fusion techniques. Similarly, consolidated statistical methods (including geospatial statistical methods) and dynamic downscaling approaches, help to expand the application potential of available data at global/EU level to produce quantitative impact assessments at local scale.\

The specific objectives of *D1.3* can be summarized as follows: \
 - to provide a list of possible data gaps in relation to Hazard (H), Exposure (E) and Vulnerability (V) as key elementary bricks of the ICARIA holistic impact assessment model; 
 - to develop a cookbook providing a list of methodologies and technical specifications for filling data gaps in impact assessment, focusing on priorities emerging from the case studies modelling workflows identified in *D1.1*.
 - to provide templates to map data gap-filling and uncertainty treatment, including expert elicitation and user-provided data, in Trials and Mini-trials;
 - to conduct a domain survey about existing and emerging data-driven methodologies; to provide the results of the domain survey as a form of recommendation for the practitioners; </div>

## <u> Structure of document </u>

<div style="text-align: justify">
The document is organized as follows: in Section 3, the main data gaps in relation to the ICARIA holistic modelling framework as emerged from Case Study Facilitators assessment and the results of the domain user survey are presented. In Section 4, the main methodologies used in ICARIA to treat data gaps and uncertainties are introduced, illustrating the the “cookbook” structure and the Jupyter book. In section 5, dedicated tables list selected literature and reference studies with respect to the identified methodologies, including those preliminarily applied in Lab Task T1.4, for their potential adoption in WP4 for Trials implementation. In section 6, the domain user survey, developed as a dedicated questionnaire for experts internal or external to the ICARIA consortium, is presented. The survey is designed to include current and emerging trends in data-driven methodologies, and the section includes the results from the testing made by 10 selected experts. Finally, in the Conclusions, a reflection on the importance of treating data gaps and uncertainties even beyond the “gap-filling” issue, but rather in relation to the correct communication of hazard/impact modelling results to inform decision makers and practitioners is introduced, aimed at supporting the presentation of impact assessments and the identification of suitable resilience measures within CoP activities in WP5. The Appendix includes the main relevant open data repositories useful to support data-gap filling in ICARIA Trials. </div>
