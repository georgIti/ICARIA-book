The ICARIA project will promote the use of a comprehensive asset-level modelling framework to achieve a better understanding of climate-related impacts produced by complex, compound and cascading disasters and the possible risk reduction provided by suitable, sustainable and cost-effective adaptation solutions.

## Who is it for?

The FAIR Cookbookâ€™s recipes are a combination of `guidance`, `technical`, `hands-on`, `background` and `review` types to cover the operation steps of FAIR data management, and are classified according to the audience types, to serve all those involved in the data management life cycle. The FAIR Cookbook is for anyone working in the Life Sciences who needs guidance on applying the FAIR Principles in practice. 
- For `researchers`, `data scientists`, and `principal investigators` examples of key recipes are those on how to handle data access, choose licenses for datasets, package data for transfer, and provide sufficient descriptive metadata.
- For `data stewards`, `data managers`, and `data curators` examples of key recipes are those providing applied FAIRification with clinical trial, epidemiological, and molecular data, as well as those on how to deal with sensitive, patient-centric data.
- For `software developers`, and `terminology managers` examples of key recipes are the technical ones focused on implementing and using a number of FAIR-enabling tools and services, which can complement their own resources. 
- Lastly, the FAIR Cookbook is a resource for `policy makers`, including `funders`, and `trainers` that can use it in their guidance material, to incentivize the practice of FAIR data management in the Life Sciences, via examples that are meaningful to the intended audience.
