# <u> Conclusions </u> 

The issue of data gaps and uncertainties treatment in quantitative hazard/impact assessment is crucial to guarantee reliability of results. A variety of methods and tools can be found in literature, with robust approaches that can increasingly rely on the ever-growing availability of high-resolution information from remote sensing, in-situ monitoring networks and citizen-science tools, as well as of computing capacity enhanced by machine learning and AI. Nevertheless, the identification and communication of data gaps and uncertainties related to specific hazard/impact modelling results is important beyond the “*data gap filling problem*”, to acknowledge uncertainties and limitations in risk assessments and simulations derived by the implementation of the ICARIA Holistic modelling framework in any s case study area.

This is even more crucial in the context of assessments encompassing the impacts on multiple assets determined by complex multi-hazard events (compound coincident, compound consecutive, cascading effects, see *D1.1*) which, compared to single-hazard assessments, highlight even more the complexity for decision makers and planners to make choices and take science-informed decisions aimed at increasing resilience. These uncertainties are related not only to the missing data concerning specific Hazard-Exposure-Vulnerability (H-E-V) variables used as input in a given impact assessment model, but intrinsic to the dynamics of compound events and cascading effects ({cite:p}`ZUCCARO2018199`), in which uncertainties such as the probability of transition among hazards, and the probability of triggering cascading effects following a given threshold of damage on a critical service asset or network component contribute to propagate errors in the quantitative assessment of the final scenario.

Therefore, considering how uncertainties related to climate change itself depend on a variety of aleatory factors and tipping points ({cite:p}`ClimateTipping2023`) it is of extreme importance that the results of ICARIA probabilistic impact assessment models, while improving their reliability through data gap filling, data refinement (and associated uncertainties) with respect to the space-time variables and to H-E-V parameters involved in the areas object of the analysis, always acknowledge all data sources used as input, existing data gaps or low-resolution data used e.g. as a proxy of a missing variable This will be achieved by mapping in the Trials and Mini-Trials modelling framework the key variables and datasets (see *D1.1* section 3.2) used, the data sources and the application (already implemented in ICARIA Lab Tasks or potential within WP4 Trial implementation) of the ICARIA cookbook. This will allow decision-makers to develop climate adaptation and resilience plans adequately informed by scientific evidence and existing limitations in knowledge, pursuing the achievement of encountering hazard events with robust and informative models and frameworks.
